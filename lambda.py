# Note:
# Lambda Function internally returns expression value and we are not required to write
# return statement explicitly.
# Note: Sometimes we can pass function as argument to another function. In such cases
# lambda functions are best choice.
# We can use lambda functions very commonly with filter(),map() and reduce() functions,b'z
# these functions expect function as argument.
